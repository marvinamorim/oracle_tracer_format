#  Oracle Tracer Format

Project created to read and format a sql file.

## Set up environment

- Prerequisites:
    - You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on 
    your machine, in any version above 3.6.

- With python installed it is preferable that you have a 
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/tutorial/venv.html) 
for the project.
    - To create a virtual environment, run:
    ```
    python3 -m venv env
    ```
    - To activate, if your operating system is GNU/Linux, use:
    ```
    . env/bin/activate
    ```
    - If your system is Windows, use:
    ```
    . venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

Once that's done, we're ready to install the dependencies.


## Dependencies and technologies used
To install the dependencies, with your virtual environment activated, use the 
command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the project

```
